    description: >
      This model finalizes the calculation of multi-year exclusion indicators 
      based on the factors derived from `int_temp_policy_multi_year_2`. It 
      determines whether to exclude a policy from the current or prior year 
      based on specific criteria. The resulting dataset is used to update 
      the dimension table `d_policy` with the calculated exclusion indicators.
    columns:
      - name: policy_key
        description: Unique identifier for the policy.
      - name: current_year_multi_year_exclusion_ind
        description: Boolean indicator for excluding the policy from current year multi-year consideration.
      - name: prior_year_multi_year_exclusion_ind
        description: Boolean indicator for excluding the policy from prior year multi-year consideration.
